Repository containing code for my MSc Project: Using Ontology-Based Tooling to Improve Cancer Data Analysis
Here you will find jupyter notebook files and Protege files amongst other files.
This project uses the Simulacrum dataset (simulated cancer data in the UK) as the primary source of data: https://simulacrum.healthdatainsight.org.uk/using-the-simulacrum/requesting-data/

## Breast Cancer Analysis (Jupyter Notebook)
A first step in understanding the cancer dataset is to understand the regimens for treatment of a cancer. To start off, I have chosen to use the simulacrum dataset and look only at patients with breast cancer (IDC10 codes between C500-C509), and show the most common regimens. This will help to design the ontology for breast cancer treatments.
